# About Me
I am currently a sophomore Computer Science student at Quinnipiac University.
<br />
My dad works in information technology and my brother is graduating with a Computer Science degree, so I was exposed to a lot of computer science growing up. It wasn't until my senior year of high school that I pursued computer science for myself. I absolutely loved the class I took, and my teacher was a huge advocate for women in STEM.
<br />
I originally went to college as a Special Education major, but switched to Computer Science during the Spring semester of my freshman year.
<br />
I currently have experience with Python, Haskell, and Java.
<br />
Although I switched majors, I do want to have a positive impact on the special needs community. In the future, I hope to be able to create apps or programs that can help people with special needs have better experiences. This can be through apps that aid learning, communication, or anything else that would be beneficial.
