[Go Fish Project](https://github.com/amberk887/GoFish)

I created an interactive game of Go Fish, where the user plays against a computer. It was challenging to make sure that the computer didn't cheat and only asked for cards it had. I wrote this program in Python.

[Wait Time Application](https://github.com/kkachmar/wait-time-app)

This was a group project that was completed using Java. It was my first time using GitHub to work with other people on a larger project. It was challenging to get a handle on all the different aspects of GitHub.
